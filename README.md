# Find a great recipe!

This is a simple recipe finder app created with **React JS**.

This app was coded entirely on CodeSandbox.io and hosted using CodeSandbox's Netlify integration.
The app takes advantage of the fantastic [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/)!

I still want to do some refinements, but it works just fine. As always, feel free to make suggestions and/or use this code on your own projects.

Here's the link so you can try it out: [Recipe Finder](https://csb-pycey.netlify.app/)
